- Total hours spent: 8
- Nr of automated unit test cases: 5 (all tests that were run are automated)
- Coverage (if available): 80%

**E2E testing:**
- Total hours estimated: 1
- Total hours spent: 1

**Code review**

- Total hours estimated: 3
- Total hours spent: 3

## ASSESSMENT
What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?
- Initially we didn’t consider unit testing, code review, and learning new techstack. 
- We weren’t clear of the actual definition of done.
- In terms of communication, we weren’t clear of the agenda of the meeting (we didn’t explicit at the beginning of the meeting the goal of the meeting, the points to cover, the issues etc)


What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?
Positive: 
- Our stakeholders were happy with the work we delivered
- Good team chemistry

Negative: 
- We could have completed more stories
- Estimations could have been realistic
- We need to work on dependencies of functional requirements and prioritize some tasks over others.
- Initial planning, workload distribution


Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve?
*Not applicable, because this is the first sprint.*

Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why?
*Not applicable, because this is the first sprint.*

Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)
Improve work definition, estimation, and self-assignment:

- Defining and assigning all the tasks required in the definition of done
- And self-assigning work accordingly 
- Be a little more realistic in terms of our estimations: we overestimated front end, we underestimated unit testing
Improving way of communication: 
- Keep the meetings short (have a meeting agenda) and strategize our discussion accordingly
- Avoid talking about issues in the meeting
- Avoid 1 to 1 communications in the meeting
- Have small group work sessions so that people assigned to similar tasks can communicate better and real time

One thing you are proud of as a Team!
We have a really good team and we have a really good chemistry. All of the people in this team are very nice. We are all very skilled and we share our knowledge.
